            <h4>Self care is the best care</h4>

              In a friendly tone: I’m sure there are some extroverts out there
              who turn inward to recharge. You can take good care of your skin
              and hair this season by ensuring you wear sunscreen to protect
              your skin and shade up. The key to feeling happy and energetic is
              to ensure you drink water, ensure you take a day of rest to care
              for your skin and hair. We all hate breakouts especially when we
              need to look our best the next day. Fortunately, we have found an
              emergency overnight solution. After cleansing your skin with the
              cleanser, apply the Moisturizing & Corrective Mask, continuing
              with the Lotion Spot Treatment. Cosmetics makers have always sold
              “hope in a jar”—creams and potions that promise youth, beauty, sex
              appeal, and even love for the women who use them. Over the last
              few years, the marketers at Giveo have added some new-and-improved
              enticements. They’re now promising self-esteem and cultural
              transformation. There is a press release, is “a global effort that
              is intended to serve as a starting point for societal change and
              act as a catalyst for widening the definition and discussion of
              beauty.” Along with its thigh-firming creams, self-tanners, and
              hair conditioners, Giveo is peddling the crowd-pleasing notions
              that beauty is a media creation, that recognizing plural forms of
              beauty is the same as declaring every woman beautiful, and that
              self-esteem means ignoring imperfections.
